# Info
JUstBedwars is a Hypixel Bedwars Companion App for finding Player Stats.

# Installation
Go to [Here](https://fex2000.github.io/JustBedwars/) and click "Download Installer", after there, I hope you have the knowledge of opening a file.

# Usage
1. Go to settings and configure your Hypixel API key. For now you have to manually get a Development Key from the [Hypixel Developer Dashboard](https://developer.hypixel.net/dashboard/)
2. Set your log file location (usually %appdata%\.minecraft\logs\latest.log)
3. Start playing bedwars, run /who after the round started and see all players in your round get listed.

# Features
- Listing players from log
- Sorting Players by FKDR
- Find all player stats by username
- Auto player adding and removal based on chatting, Finals and disconnects
## Planned
- Get a Application API key (Will do after more features are added)
- Sorting players by general skill and not just FKDR
- Always on top mode
